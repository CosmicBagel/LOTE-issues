# LOTE-issues
Issues tracker for Life on the Edge

1. To get started open the `Issues` tab at the top
2. Search for your bug in the existing issues to ensure it does not exist
    - Its important to remember that many different nouns and adjectives are used when naming so be thorough 
    - Over time we'll establish a more consitent vocabulary, if you see a noun being used to describe something
    stick with that one noun to simplify searching
3. If your issue doesn't exist hit `New Issue` and file your bug
    - The more information you provide, the more useful the bug report will be and the more likely it is we'll be able to fix the bug
    - Add the appropriate labels! (Performance, Visual, Audio, Gameplay, UI, ect)
